          <p className="text-gray-600">
            The frequency of detailing depends on factors such as your driving habits, environmental conditions, and personal preferences. As a general guideline, we recommend scheduling detailing appointments every 3 to 6 months to keep your vehicle looking its best and maintain value.

            Yes, please make sure to remove all personal items and belongings from your vehicle. This allows us to provide the most thorough and efficient service possible.

        question: "What happens if it rains on the day of my appointment?",
        answer: (
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            In the event of rain, we typically do not perform detailing services. However, we assess the situation on a case-by-case basis to see if we can still complete the job. If not, we will promptly reschedule your appointment for the earliest available time.
